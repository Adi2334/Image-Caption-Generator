# This is the tutorial for **Image Caption Generator using Deep Learning**  

### These are the major steps that were followed to create this model/project
1. Dataset collection
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing
3. Model architecture 
4. Model training 
5. Model evaluation
6. Model deployment

## **1. Dataset collection**  
Find a dataset (size according to your system capacity) for **image captioning** which can be easily found on **Kaggle** or elsewhere. Read and understand the structure of the dataset.


*For my project I used Flickr8k dataset which contained 8000 images each with atleast one caption* 


#### **Data Augmentation**  
To improve model performance, images were **horizontally flipped**.

## **2. Data cleaning and preprocessing**

## **3. Model architecture**

## **4. Model training**

## **5. Model evaluation**

## **6. Model deployment**
